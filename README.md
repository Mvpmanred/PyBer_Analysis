# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of analysis
I will be using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. And then I will use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, I will submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
