# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of analysis
 I will be using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. And then I will use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, I will submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
## Results

 The first graph visually illustrates total fare by City type. There are 3 types of city: rural, suburban and urban. The second graph shows the analysis of ride-sharing data among the different city types.
- From our analysis of the graphs, we can concude that Urban cities generate more toal fares and total rides than those of rural and suburban cities. Urban cities have total 1625 rides and total fares of $39,854.38; rural cities have 125 total rides and total fares of $4,327.93; suburban cities have total 625 rides and total fares of $19,356.33.
- When we take a deeper analysis, we can see that there are 2,405 drivers in urban cities while there are only 78 drivers in rural cities and 490 drivers in suburban cities. The differences in average fare per ride is also obvious. Average fare per ride in rural cities is $34.62 which is 11.79% higher than suburban cities ($30.97) and 41.13% higher than urban cities ($24.53). Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride.
- In average fare per driver, we spot the gap between rural and urban cities is wider than that of average fare per ride. The average fare per driver in rural is $55.49 which is 40.48% higher than suburban($39.50) and 234.88% higher than Urban cities ($16.57). Rural cities have the highest average fare per driver.

# Summary
 Based on the results, there are 2405 drivers in urban cities but there are only 1625 total rides. In other words, some drivers couldn't get any cusomters. Therefore, we can provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing and solving some of the problmes among the different city types.
 - Increase fare per ride by 10% in suburban cities, and that 10% extra belongs to urban drivers who willing to take rides to suburban cities.
 - Increase fare per ride by 20% in rural cities, and that 20% extra belongs to urban drivers who willing to take rides to rural cities.
 - Increase fare per ride by 2% in urban cities, in order to keep urban drivers stay working in urban cities.
  We can launch this strong incentive program to encourage/deoply more drivers from urban cities to suburban and rural cities.
